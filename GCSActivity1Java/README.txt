My name is John Fitzpatrick, and this is my submission for the GCS Coding Activity 1 assignment. This program was written in Java in the Eclipse IDE. 

The program consists of two files: Main.java, which handles user input and storage for the list of favorite cities, and WeatherAPIGetter.java, which handles calls to the OpenWeatherAPI.

The program relies on several built-in JRE libraries, as well as an external library for JSON parsing, org.simple.json. The JAR file for that latter library can be found in the project's root directory. 

IMPORTANT: This project has been posted without an API key for OpenWeather, as OpenWeatherAPI keys have a limited number of free uses. To run this program yourself, please paste a valid OpenWeatherAPI key in the indicated place on Line 20 of the WeatherAPIGetter.java file.
